# JetEngine
This project is the CAD files and drawings for the jet engine I designed and built from scratch with my friends in our senior year of high school. You can see the documentation of the design process on my [personal website](https://ryanhaug.xyz/projects/jet-engine.html). I also have uploaded the videos of testing the jet engine to my youtube channel found [here with the test of the combustor](https://youtu.be/qZWnE_8dQdU) and [here for the test of the entire engine](https://youtu.be/sN9D55REclQ).
